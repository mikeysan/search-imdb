## This afternoon someone told me about a movie they watched called Kite

The movie rang a bell but I couldn't remember if I had seen it or anything else about it so I decided I would look it up. It was at this moment that I thought "hang on! there should be an api for imdb so that I can integrate it into my bot and do a search write within discord.
